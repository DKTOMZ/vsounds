                My name is Dennis Tomno, a fullstack developer. This was a fun project to work on
                because I learnt a lot of the processess involved in a large scale web application
                such as requirements definition, planning, designing and even continuous deployment.
            </p>
            <p>
                I also learnt a lot about react and nodejs and can confidently build and deploy a fullstack web application.
